Migrating to nextjs with turborepo
1. npx create-turbo@latest (Name the repo)
2. For creating a new ui repo - npx create-next-app@latest inside apps folder
3. Add in package.json of new client repo
"dependencies": {
    "ui": "*"
  }
4. Add in next.config.js of new client repo
{
  reactStrictMode: true,
  transpilePackages: ["ui"],
};
Backend setup in monorepo
5. mkdir db inside packages folder
6. npm init -y, tsc --init to create tsconfig.json
7. Add in package.json
"main": "src/",
"": "src/"
8. Always good to do npm install and npm build at the root folder after any changes made in sub repos.
9. The apps folder contains client-next, docs, web, express-backend. They all do their transpiling for themselves. That means web will do transpiling of typescript to js only for its use. Similarly, docs, client-next, express-backend will do their individual transipling. 
10. So, what do they transpile exactly ? They transiple the code they need from the packages folder which resides inside the root.
